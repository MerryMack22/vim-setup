==========================
These are my notes/directions on how to use my
custom laravel shortcuts
==========================


1. Abbreviations
2. File shortcuts
3. Functions


--------------------------
1. Abbreviations

  I have added several abbreviations to make repetitive phrases
  quick to type:

    pft  -> PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    gm   -> !php artisan generate:model
    gc   -> !php artisan generate:controller
    gmig -> !php artisan generate:migration

  Pressing space or enter after typing any of these abbreviations
  will cause vim to automatically replace it with the defined string.


--------------------------
2. File shortcuts

  These shortcuts are based on the <leader> key (default '\').
  So for each of these shortcuts the leader key must be pressed
  first.

    lr  -> app/routes.php
    lca -> app/config/app.php
    lcd -> app/config/database.php
    lc  -> composer.json

  After activating a shortcut, vim will open (or create) the specified
  file in the currently active window.

      This prompts you for a facade name and then opens the
      appropriate file from /vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate

      Available Facade Names:
        Form      -> Html/FormBuilder.php (Not native, edit as needed)
        Html      -> Html/HtmlBuilder.php (Not native, edit as needed)
        File      -> Filesystem/Filesystem.php
        Eloquent  -> Database/Eloquent/Model.php

      This prompts you for a class name and an optional namespace then creates
      the new class under the cursor

    2
      This prompts you for a variable name and a path. Honestly I've no idea
      what this is trying to do. I found it at https://gist.github.com/JeffreyWay/6753834
      Just don't bother with this one.
